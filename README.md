Update files for Nexus TV IPTV PLayer
NEXUS TV - INSTALLATION GUIDE

Why does Windows block this app?
- Nexus TV is not code-signed (requires $200/year certificate)
- Windows Defender flags ALL unsigned software as "potentially unsafe"
- This is a false positive - the app is safe

How to install:

WINDOWS DEFENDER:
1. Download Nexus TV Setup.exe
2. Windows will show "Windows protected your PC"
3. Click "More info"
4. Click "Run anyway"
5. Follow installer
These are normal behaviors for an IPTV player, but antivirus
software can't tell the difference between this and malware
without a digital signature.

The app does NOT:
❌ Steal your data
❌ Install viruses
❌ Access your files
❌ Send information to third parties
❌ Mine cryptocurrency
❌ Encrypt your files

It's simply an unsigned application, which Windows treats
as "potentially unsafe" by default.

To verify: Upload the .exe to VirusTotal.com
